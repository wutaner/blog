# Hi, I'm wutaner

Three years ago, I left the geophysics industry where I had worked for over twenty years to take a break and do things I enjoy. My days consisted of running, watching TV, and helping my kids with their homework. I also spent a lot of time on Twitter, researching NFTs, and analyzing cryptocurrencies.

While it was comfortable, I gradually grew tired of this version of myself. When my children ask me, "Dad, what did you do today?", I don't want to always reply, "I was making money." I feel I should go back to doing something beneficial for society, like I used to.

Having been involved with BTC since 2010, I've learned a lot about cryptocurrency on my own, and I believe I can make a contribution. Here are some of my ideas:

1. Write a series of "Crypto 101" articles.

2. Be more active on X, interacting and answering questions.

3. Write down some of my ideas or develop prototypes for them.

4. Actively participate in the Ethereum community.

I modified the hugo-bearblog theme to create this blog template, trying my best to replicate [Bear Blog ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ](https://bearblog.dev/).
