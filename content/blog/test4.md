I'm a bit late to the question challenge posed by Ava. I just arrived back from a 7 day hike up the Wild Coast of South Africa, which was beautiful, relaxing, and a great way to usher in the new year.

On arriving back I noticed a sharp increase in signups on Bear (new year; new blog!) and had to do some infrastructural work and house-keeping. I apologise to everyone who had timeout issues over the first week of January. This has been resolved and I have auto-scalers in place to prevent timeouts from happening in the future.

Before I get into the questions, I'd like to give a shout-out to both Kev Quirk and Manu. I follow both of their RSS feeds and was pleasantly surprised to see the Bear Blog question challenge on their blogs, despite being off-platform. It's been so interesting and lovely reading about everyone's blogging journeys.

Let's do this!
